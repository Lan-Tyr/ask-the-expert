# ask-the-expert
A program that tells you the capitals of countries of the world.
This program utilizes a text file (capital_data.txt); you input the country you would like to know the capital city of, and it draws the answer from the text file. If it doesn't have the answer, then it will ask you to give it the answer, which it will update in the text file.
It's limited in that it relies on the user giving it accurate information, but it's a pretty cool little program for playing around with drawing from and updating separate files.
